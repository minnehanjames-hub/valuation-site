# lbo_simulator
This project is a simplified LBO (Leveraged Buyout) Model Simulator, built in Python using Gradio for the user interface.
Users can adjust key deal assumptions — such as purchase price, leverage ratio, interest rate, holding period, and exit multiple — to instantly see how these affect IRR (Internal Rate of Return) and MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital).
